          <h2>Piano Technical Terms</h2>
        </header>
        <article>
            <p>Here are some basic piano terms you should know: An octave refers to the interval between one note and the next with the same name, such as middle C to the C above it, encompassing eight notes.</p>
            <p>A scale is a sequence of notes in ascending or descending order, forming the foundation of melodies and chords. Scales help in developing finger strength and understanding tonal structure.</p>
            <p>The chord is a harmonic combination of three or more notes played simultaneously. Chords are essential for creating harmony in music and are often used in accompaniment.</p>
            <p>Arpeggios, or broken chords, are notes of a chord played in succession rather than together. They are frequently used in piano exercises to develop agility and control.</p>
            <p>The tempo defines the speed of a piece, while dynamics indicate the volume, ranging from soft (piano) to loud (forte). These are crucial for expressive playing and setting the mood of a composition.</p>
            <p>These terms are fundamental for reading sheet music, communicating with other musicians, and understanding the structure of musical compositions. Mastery of these basics is key to advancing as a pianist.</p>
            <p>An octave is one of the building blocks of piano music, spanning eight notes within a scale. Each octave doubles the frequency of the previous one, creating a sense of symmetry and balance.</p>
            <p>This structure allows pianists to play the same melody in different ranges, adding depth to compositions. Octaves are commonly used in classical music to reinforce bass lines or create powerful climaxes.</p>
            <p>In jazz and pop, octaves can provide rhythmic drive and texture. The piano keyboard's visual layout makes it easy to locate octaves, as they repeat every 12 keys.</p>
            <p>Beginners practice octaves to improve hand span and finger strength. These exercises are essential for building the technical foundation required for more complex pieces.</p>
            <p>Advanced players use octaves for expressive dynamics, adding drama and intensity to their performances. The proper use of octaves can elevate a compositions emotional impact.</p>
            <p>Understanding octaves helps pianists grasp the relationship between notes and their harmonic contexts. This knowledge is vital for both improvisation and interpreting written music.</p>
             <ul>
                <li>Middle C: The central note on the piano.</li>
                <Li>Scale: A sequence of notes arranged by pitch.</li>
                <li>Chord: A combination of three or more notes played together.</li>

            <code>C - D - E - F - G - A - B - C</code> 
            <p>The white keys on the piano represent the natural notes: A, B, C, D, E, F, and G. These notes repeat in a cycle across the keyboard. For instance, after G, the sequence starts again with A. This cyclical nature is easy to grasp and helps beginners identify keys quickly.</p>
            <p>Each white key corresponds to a specific pitch, which aligns with musical notation. Middle C, for example, is a landmark note often used as a reference point for learning the keyboard. The white keys form the basis of major and minor scales, which are fundamental for understanding music theory.</p>
            <p>Notes like A and G have historical significance, tracing back to early musical systems. While the white keys are labeled with simple letters, their relationships form the foundation of chords and melodies. For example, C, E, and G played together create a C major chord.</p>
            <code>Middle C is represented as "C4" in scientific pitch notation.</code>
            <p>The simplicity of white keys makes it easier for beginners to start playing melodies. Advanced players use these keys to create intricate harmonies and expressive phrases. The white keys are also the primary focus when sight-reading sheet music, making them integral to classical training.</p>
            <p>Understanding their arrangement is a stepping stone to mastering the black keys and more complex musical ideas. The white keys are essential for musicians of all levels, bridging the gap between basic and advanced techniques in piano performance.</p>
